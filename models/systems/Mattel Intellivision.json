They succeeded in bringing the first home video game system to market, the Odyssey, which was quickly followed by a number of later models, each with a few technological improvements (Magnavox Odyssey Series). In 1978, Magnavox, now a subsidiary of North American Philips, released the Odyssey\u00b2, its new second-generation video game console.\n\nIn 2009, the video game website IGN named the Odyssey\u00b2 the 21st greatest video game console, out of its list of 25.",
