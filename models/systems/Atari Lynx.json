The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world&#039;s first handheld electronic game with a color LCD. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. As part of the fourth generation of gaming, the Lynx competed with Nintendo&#039;s Game Boy (released just a month earlier), the Sega Game Gear and NEC&#039;s TurboExpress, both released the following year.",
