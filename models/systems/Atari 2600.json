      "overview": "The Atari 2600 is a video game console released in October 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and cartridges containing game code, instead of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware with all games built in. The first game console to use this format was the Fairchild Channel F; however, the Atari 2600 receives credit for making the plug-in concept popular among the game-playing public.\nThe console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200, in 1982, the VCS was renamed &quot;Atari 2600&quot;, after the unit&#039;s Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a cartridge game\u2014initially Combat and later Pac-Man.\n\nThe Atari 2600 was wildly successful, and during much of the 1980s, &quot;Atari&quot; was a synonym for this model in mainstream media and, by extension, for video games in general.",
